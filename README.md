Simple alias for [`generator-ng-fullstack`](https://github.com/ericmdantas/generator-ng-fullstack).

### DISCLAIMER

This is a work in progress. Wait for 1.0.0 until you use it in your workflow.

### What?

The idea is to have something similar to [`angular-cli`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) - but with `ng-fullstack` in mind.

### Why?

Because typing `yo ng-fullstack:component people_list_cmp --feature person` all the time sucks.

### How?

`ngf` simply passes the info to `ng-fullstack`, there's no black magic involved.

### API

Following what's done in `angular-cli`, we have:

```shell
 $ ngf g component people_list_cmp --feat person

 # creates a new component called people_list_cmp
 
 # g: means `generate`
 # component: is the type of file that's being created
 # people_list_cmp: is the name given to the file/component
 # --feat: means the `--feature`, which is the context to the created file
 ```
